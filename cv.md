## Self-Introduction:
  I started my studies with Olympiad programming and I really enjoyed making efforts and showing creative thinking. I want to continue developing my skills in the frontend. My goal is to learn how to work with javascript CSS and HTML.


  I have experience in creating projects in a team. Basically, I managed the process and delegated responsibilities, which is probably why I appreciate such qualities as communication skills, critical thinking, conflict resolution and creativity.

  
At the moment I am studying at BSUIR, which inspires me to self-study in such an area as frontend

## Code example:
Complete the findNextSquare method that finds the next integral perfect square after the one passed as a parameter. Recall that an integral perfect square is an integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an integer.

If the parameter is itself not a perfect square then -1 should be returned. You may assume the parameter is non-negative.

    function findNextSquare(sq) {
    if (Number.isInteger(Math.sqrt(sq)))
       return Math.pow((Math.sqrt(sq)+1),2);
    else return -1;
    }
